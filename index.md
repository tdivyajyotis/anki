# So yeah, you found the secret website! : )
## Happy New Year 2022 ofc!
Did you like my little card? You can remove that paper crane on it (it has the link on the inside of its wings !)
### Sorry, Ankita
I couldn't chat on discord like I used to coz my parents were shouting coz I woke up late and I had a headache.

I hope your laptop gets fixed soon. I made this as a return gift for the ring. I wrote a poem myself and my last words in this message.
```
Ye duniya mein sab hai
Dhokebaaz bhi aur pyare bhi

Jab ye pura duniya mera shatru ban gaya
Tum hi mere sang the

Tum ne jab pehli baar mere saath rahe
Mera jeewan sampoorn aur saral hua

Tum hi mujhko raah do
Mere saath rehna sada
Mujhe jeene ki arzi de rabba
```
I am not depressed or anything just grateful to you!

The last year was probably the best time of my life, because you changed my mind and it improved almost everything for me. I hope you remain happy forever. And again, Sorry for today.


Love you my lady

Yours truly and only

-Divyajyoti
